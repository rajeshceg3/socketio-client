# Product Requirements Document: Real-Time Click Tracker

## 1. Introduction
The Real-Time Click Tracker is a simple web application designed to demonstrate the use of WebSockets for instant communication between a server and multiple clients. Its core function is to track the total number of times a button is clicked and display this count in real-time to all connected users.

## 2. Goals and Objectives
- **Goal:** Provide a clear and functional example of real-time client-server communication using Socket.io.
- **Objective 1:** Accurately count and display button clicks from any connected client.
- **Objective 2:** Ensure click count updates are propagated to all connected clients virtually instantaneously.
- **Objective 3:** Maintain a simple and understandable codebase suitable for educational purposes.

## 3. Target Audience
- Developers learning about WebSockets and real-time web applications.
- Hobbyists or students looking for a simple project template.

## 4. Functional Requirements
- **FR1:** The server must accept WebSocket connections from clients.
- **FR2:** Clients must be able to send a "button clicked" event to the server.
- **FR3:** The server must maintain a persistent counter for the total number of clicks received.
- **FR4:** Upon receiving a "button clicked" event, the server must increment the click counter.
- **FR5:** The server must broadcast the updated click count to all connected clients after each increment.
- **FR6:** The client interface must display a button that users can click.
- **FR7:** The client interface must display the current total click count, updated in real-time.
- **FR8:** The server should serve the client HTML page.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1: Usability:** The application should be simple to understand and use. The interface will be minimal, focusing on the core functionality.
- **NFR2: Performance:** Click updates should appear to be real-time, with minimal perceptible delay (e.g., < 500ms).
- **NFR3: Scalability (Basic):** The server should handle a small number of concurrent connections (e.g., 5-10 for demonstration purposes) without significant performance degradation. (Note: True scalability would require more advanced architecture).
- **NFR4: Reliability:** The application should function consistently, with click counts accurately reflected. Basic error handling should be in place for connection issues.
- **NFR5: Maintainability:** The code should be well-commented and structured to be easily understood.

## 6. User Stories
- **US1:** As a user, I want to see a button on the webpage so that I can click it.
- **US2:** As a user, when I click the button, I want my click to be registered by the system.
- **US3:** As a user, I want to see a counter on the webpage that shows the total number of times the button has been clicked by all users.
- **US4:** As a user, when another user clicks the button, I want the counter on my page to update in real-time without me needing to refresh the page.
- **US5:** As a developer, I want to be able to easily set up and run the project to understand how it works.

## 7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for initial version)
-   User-specific click tracking.
-   Persistence of click count across server restarts (e.g., using a database).
-   More advanced UI/UX.
-   Authentication for users.
-   More robust error handling and reporting.
